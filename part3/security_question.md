# Security Audit for Solar Panel Installation App

## Introduction

As the head of Engineering for our solar panel installation startup, ensuring the security of our app's infrastructure is important.
## OWASP Top 10 Analysis

### 1. **Injection**
   - **Risk**: SQL Injection attacks on the Python backend accessing the MySQL database.
   - **Mitigation**: Use parameterized queries and prepared statements in Python backend to prevent SQL injections. Regularly update MySQL and Python connectors to the latest secure versions.

### 2. **Broken Authentication and Session Management**
   - **Risk**: Weak authentication mechanisms leading to unauthorized access.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement strong password policies, multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user roles. Use secure JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management. Regularly audit authentication mechanisms and session timeouts.

### 3. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - **Risk**: Unauthorized access to sensitive customer data stored in the MySQL database.
   - **Mitigation**: Encrypt customer data at rest using tools like AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Implement robust access controls and encryption for sensitive fields like passwords. Regularly audit database access logs.

### 4. **Security Misconfigurations**
   - **Risk**: Improperly configured AWS services and Kubernetes containers.
   - **Mitigation**: Follow AWS Well-Architected Framework for secure infrastructure setup. Regularly audit AWS IAM policies. Ensure Kubernetes configurations are secure, restrict container permissions, and implement network policies.

### 5. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web Frontend**
   - **Risk**: Injection of malicious scripts into customer-facing web frontend.
   - **Mitigation**: Sanitize user inputs in the frontend using libraries like DOMPurify. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to prevent script execution from unauthorized sources.

### 6. **Insecure Deserialization (Specific to Python Backend)**
   - **Risk**: Insecure deserialization leading to remote code execution.
   - **Mitigation**: Use safe deserialization libraries in Python backend. Validate and sanitize serialized data. Avoid deserializing untrusted data.

### 7. **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities (Specific to JavaScript Libraries and Python Packages)**
   - **Risk**: Outdated or vulnerable JavaScript libraries and Python packages.
   - **Mitigation**: Regularly update dependencies using package managers. Use tools like `snyk` or `OWASP Dependency-Check` to identify vulnerabilities in third-party components.

### 8. **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**
   - **Risk**: Inadequate logging and monitoring, hindering incident detection.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement extensive logging for all components. Utilize AWS CloudWatch or similar services for centralized logging. Set up alerts for specific events like failed login attempts or unauthorized access. Regularly review logs and conduct security incident response drills.


## User Roles and Access Control

- **Software Engineer Employees (12)**
  - Limit access to essential development resources.
  - Enforce secure coding practices and conduct regular security training.
  - Implement code review processes to identify and fix security issues before deployment.

- **Customer Support Employees (3)**
  - Access to customer information should be strictly limited to job requirements.
  - Implement strong authentication for support tools and monitor access logs.

- **Sales Employee (1)**
  - Access limited to sales-related data and tools.
  - Implement strict access controls and conduct regular access reviews.
